# Pre-Launch Verification Report - LivePlan³

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive verification of the financial calculation logic in the LivePlan³ application and the improvements implemented to ensure the app is 100% functional before submission to Google Play.

## Issues Identified and Implemented Fixes

### 1. Fixed Initial Balance on Statement Page

**Issue:** The initial balance was set as a fixed zero, which did not reflect the user's actual balance.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Created an `OpeningBalanceModal` component to allow users to configure their initial balance
- Implemented localStorage storage for the initial balance
- Added a button on the Statement page to access the initial balance configuration
- Integrated the configurable initial balance with balance calculations

### 2. Inconsistent Currency Formatting

**Issue:** There was no explicit handling for rounding monetary values in some components.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Improved the `formatCurrency` function to ensure consistent formatting with AUD and two decimal places
- Added handling for invalid values (NaN) in formatting
- Documented all formatting functions for easier future maintenance
- Exported additional utility functions for use throughout the application

### 3. Handling Negative Values in the 50/30/20 Formula

**Issue:** There was no specific handling for negative values in all parts of the code.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Added handling to ensure only positive values are used in percentage calculations
- Implemented consistently across all pages using the 50/30/20 formula:
  - Dashboard
  - ExpensesPage
  - Home

## Consistency Verification

All pages implementing the 50/30/20 formula now use the same calculation logic:

1. Calculation of fixed expenses, variable expenses, and investments values
2. Determination of the target total value (maximum between total expenses and total income)
3. Handling of negative values for percentage calculations
4. Consistent calculation of target percentages (50%, 30%, 20%)

## Tests Performed

- **Balance Calculation:** Verified that the configurable initial balance is correctly used in calculations
- **Currency Formatting:** Confirmed that all monetary values are consistently displayed with AUD and two decimal places
- **50/30/20 Formula:** Verified that the formula works correctly even with negative or zero values

## Conclusion

The LivePlan³ application is now technically ready to be submitted to Google Play. All implemented fixes ensure that:

1. The financial calculation logic is working correctly
2. Values are displayed consistently and professionally
3. The application properly handles edge cases (negative values, zero, etc.)
4. The user experience is enhanced with visual feedback and notifications

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Real User Testing:** Conduct tests with a small group of users before full launch
2. **Post-Launch Monitoring:** Implement analytics tools to monitor application usage
3. **Continuous Feedback:** Create a channel for users to report issues or suggest improvements
